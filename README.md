Bare Metal -

The term "bare metal" refers to a hard disk, the usual medium on which a computer's OS(operating System)is installed. The term virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual version of something, such as an OS(Operating System), a server or a network resource.

Bare Metal Server-

A 'bare-metal server' is a computer server that is a 'single-tenant physical server'. The term is used nowadays to distinguish it from modern forms of virtualization and cloud hosting. Bare-metal servers have a single 'tenant'. They are not shared between custom

Dedicated servers provide powerful performance and isolated security, and cloud servers give flexibility of resources and pay-as-you-use billing. Bare metal servers combine those features into one best-of-both-worlds server solution

Why ??

Because of the unique combination of high performance and flexibility, bare metal servers have a wide variety of use cases for short-term, resource-intensive needs.

VMware -

VMware Workstation is a virtual machine software that is used for x86 and x86-64 computers to run multiple operating systems over a single physical host computer. Each virtual machine can run a single instance of any operating system (Microsoft, Linux, etc.) simultaneously.

Why ??

VMware Server is a virtualization product that makes it possible to partition a single physical server into multiple virtual machines. VMware Server facilitates software testing in virtual machines without installation and configuration. Patches and experimental operating systems can be tested as well. 

Hypervisor -

hypervisor, is virtualization software that is installed on hardware directly. At its core, the hypervisor is the host or operating system. It is structured to allow for the virtualization of underlying hardware components to function as if they have direct access to the hardware

What is a purpose of hypervisor??

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor, is a process that creates and runs virtual machines . A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, like memory and processing. Generally, there are two types of hypervisors.

NOTE:-
KVM - Kernel based virtual machine. 
Hyper-V -Windows Server Virtualization. 

Virtual Machine -

A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.

A virtual machine app creates a virtualized environment,a virtual machine that behaves like a separate computer system, complete with virtual hardware devices. The VM runs as a process in a window on your current operating system.The VM app presents this file the guest OS as a real hard drive.

Page Rank algorithm -

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages

Inventer- Larry page,Sergey Brin.

PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

Onion Routing -

Onion routing is a technique for anonymous communication over a computer network. In an onion network, messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to layers of an onion. There is a large set of precautionary measures and best practices to make web browsing safer and more secure for users.

TOR (The Onion Router)

Tor aims to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe.

Written in: C,Python,Rust.

Namespace -

Namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name. A namespace ensures that all the identifiers within it have unique names so that they can be easily identified.

Jail Break -

Jailbreaking means bypassing the restrictions Apple puts on the operating system and taking full control of the device. With a jailbroken device, you can install apps and tweaks that aren't authorized by Apple, but you also remove the tough security protections that Apple has built into iOS.

Data store -

A Data Store is a connection to a store of data, whether the data is stored in a database or in one or more files. The data store may be used as the source of data for a process, or you may export the written Staged Data results of a process to a data store, or both.

It is normally recommended to connect to the data store via the server. When connecting to files, this means that the files must exist in the server landing area to ensure that the server will be able to access them. However, it is also possible to pull the data onto the server using a client connection.

NOTE -

<strong>Centralization </strong>- The concentration of control of an activity or organization under a single authority. 

<strong>Decentralization</strong>- Decentralization is the process of distributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority.
 
Blockchain - 

A decentralized computation and information sharing platform that enables multiple authoritative domains,who do not trust each other ,to coordinate and collaboration in a rational decision making process.

Raft -(Role, Audience, Format and Topic.)

Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm. It was designed to be easily understood. It solves the problem of getting multiple servers to agree on a shared state even in the face of failures.Raft works by electing a leader in the cluster.

*Cluster- A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

*ETCD - is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.

*Kubernetes uses etcd to store all its data – its configuration data, its state, and its metadata. Kubernetes is a distributed system, so it needs a distributed data store like etcd. etcd lets any of the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster read and write data.
 
Data Serialization -

Data serialization is the process of converting structured data to a format that allows sharing or storage of the data in a form that allows recovery of its original structure.
             
             
                                  -------> JSON (Javascript object notation)
     {data serialization}         -------> YAML (Yet another markup language)
                                  -------> XML (Extensible markup language)
                                  -------> PROTOCOL BUFFERS(Protobuf)
   
 XML -  1998
   
Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable

Developed by: W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web).
Extended from: SGML( The Standard Generalized Markup Language is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents)

JSON - 2001

JavaScript Object Notation is an open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types.
JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to XML. 

Extended from: JavaScript 

YAML

YAML Ain't Markup Language is a data serialization language that matches user’s expectations about data. It designed to be human friendly and works perfectly with other programming languages. It is useful to manage data and includes Unicode printable characters. 
YAML is to configuration what markdown is to markup. It’s basically a human-readable structured data format. It is less complex and ungainly than XML or JSON, but provides similar capabilities. It essentially allows you to provide powerful configuration settings, without having to learn a more complex code type like CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)-

Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data. The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.
